### Useful links
The ESP32 and USB design follows the same format as the
[HUZZAH32 ESP32 Feather](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-HUZZAH32-ESP32-Feather-PCB),
so check out their [documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/overview)
for programming the board using the Arduino IDE.

The battery charge design follows the same format as the [PowerBoost 500](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PowerBoost-500-Charger-PCB).
An overview can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-powerboost-500-plus-charger/overview).
